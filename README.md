# Group-Theory

This repository contains homework assignments from a group theory course taught in the spring of 2020 at Stony Brook University by 
Peter Van Nieuwenhuizen.

phy680_s2020_hwxx.pdf files contain the assignments we were given. All other files contain my typeset solutions to the corresponding assignments. Which file corresponds to which assignment should be clear from the naming.
